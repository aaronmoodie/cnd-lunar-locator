# CND Lunar Locator

This is my Lunar Locator app, built for the Car Next Door programming assignment. The working version is viewable via the Heroku link below. Visually, I got this to a reasonable place, but my code could have been a bit better. I chose to use Backbone served via a Sinatra app, as this is what I was most familiar with. With a little more time I would have looked at adding a package manager for the Javascript, which would have let me break the main app file up. The commenting and overall code structure could be cleaner as well.

#### Design

I've added in the design process I went through prior to starting on the code. My initial steps where to sketch out some ideas to make sure I covered all of the requirements. I specifically focused on ease of use, which was why I ended up collecting all the vehicles into a collection before loading them in the app.

> CND Staff are notoriously fickle and won't use a tool that is difficult to use or difficult to look at.

Selecting a vehicle primarily by ID seemed like it would make for a difficult UI.

After working on the sketches, I started working on polishing these a little in Sketch.

When the layout seemed like it was in a good position, I looked at fleshing out the visual design a little. This was all still pretty light on in terms of process, but overall I'm pretty happy with where I got to in 3 days.
